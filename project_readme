This project is designed to find trends in a database of over 1,000 titles, that indicate a high return on investment(ROI).

Using the runtime data, we were able to find that movies between 80-140 minutes were more likely to generate a higher ROI.

Using the release date data, we were able to find which months had higher rates of ROI (July and October), as well as likely competition within those months.

Using the genre data, we were able to identify the top three genres with a high ROI (horror, mystery, and thriller).  Also interesting to note, is that these three genres are similiar and can easily be combined in one production.
